object model : consist of two things
    one class(also called page) : webElements + methods 
    test file: spec file in cypress , scenarios or test methods in java selenium 

 the Page Object Model helps in creating a clear separation between test code and the details of the UI,
 leading to more robust and maintainable automated tests.


In java selenium project : we separated pages:(webelements and methods) and scenarios: which contained test
In cypress project : we separated pages and spec file
